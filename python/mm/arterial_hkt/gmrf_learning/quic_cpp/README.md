C++ implementation of QUIC
---------------------------

This is the implementaiton of QUIC [1].

What you need to compile it:
  - a C++ compiler
  - numpy and python development packages (numpy-dev, python-dev)
  - fortran, blas and lapack development libraries
  - boost python development libraries [2]

Compile the source code by typing 'make'. If it does not work, look at it as a basis to start.
